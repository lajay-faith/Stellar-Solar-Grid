## Energy Forecasting Service (#881)

`GET /api/weather/energy-forecast`

Returns hourly production and/or consumption estimates for up to 48 hours. At
least one of `meterId` or `deviceId` is required. A `deviceId` must identify a
registered `solar_panel`; its `ratedPowerW`, `latitude`, and `longitude` specs
are used when available. `lat` and `lon` may be supplied explicitly and are
required for meter-only requests. `hours` defaults to 48 and may be an integer
from 1 through 48.

Example:

```text
GET /api/weather/energy-forecast?meterId=METER_01&deviceId=PANEL_01&hours=48
```

Consumption training reads the previous 90 days of meter usage and converts
the platform's milli-kWh event units to kWh. Production training uses the
previous 90 days of registered solar-panel performance telemetry. Both models
use a regularized seasonal regression over hour-of-day and weekday features;
missing hours are treated as zero. OpenWeather hourly cloud cover and
temperature adjust production estimates; temperature adjusts consumption
estimates. Precipitation probability is included as forecast context. Models retrain at
startup and every six hours by default; configure the interval with
`ENERGY_FORECAST_RETRAIN_INTERVAL_MS`.

The response includes per-stream `trainingSamples`, `accuracyPct`, and
`trainedAt`. Accuracy is a held-out weighted absolute-error score and is `null`
when there is no usable validation history; the service does not claim a fixed
accuracy for meters or sites without representative historical data.

```json
{
  "horizonHours": 48,
  "weatherStale": false,
  "models": {
    "production": { "algorithm": "seasonal-ridge", "trainingSamples": 1200, "accuracyPct": 91.2 },
    "consumption": { "algorithm": "seasonal-ridge", "trainingSamples": 2160, "accuracyPct": 88.5 }
  },
  "forecast": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2026-09-29T12:00:00.000Z",
      "productionKwh": 2.15,
      "consumptionKwh": 0.42,
      "weather": { "temperatureC": 22, "cloudCoverPct": 18, "productionFactor": 0.91 }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Energy Grid Simulation Tool (#909)

The simulation tool lets operators test grid scenarios, inspect grid state,
run what-if analyses, and generate impact reports for capacity planning.

### Simulation engine

`POST /api/grid/simulate`

Runs a simulation for a given scenario and returns the resulting grid state.

Request body:

```json
{
  "scenario": {
    "name": "peak-summer-demand",
    "durationHours": 24,
    "stepMinutes": 15,
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "gen-1", "type": "generator", "capacityMw": 500, "outputMw": 420 },
      { "id": "load-1", "type": "load", "demandMw": 380 }
    ],
    "links": [

  }
}
```

### Scenario builder

`POST /api/grid/scenarios`

Creates a reusable scenario definition. The body accepts the same `scenario`
object as the simulate endpoint.

`GET /api/grid/scenarios` — list saved scenarios.

`GET /api/grid/scenarios/{id}` — fetch a single scenario.

`PUT /api/grid/scenarios/{id}` — update a scenario.

`DELETE /api/grid/scenarios/{id}` — remove a scenario.

### Visualization

`GET /api/grid/scenarios/{id}/state`

Returns the latest simulated grid state as a render-ready payload for the
frontend (nodes with positions/status and links with flow values).

```json
{
  "scenarioId": "peak-summer-demand",
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "gen-1", "type": "generator", "status": "nominal", "utilization": 0.84 },
    { "id": "load-1", "type": "load", "status": "served", "utilization": 0.63 }
  ],
  "links": [
    { "from": "gen-1", "to": "load-1", "flowMw": 380, "status": "nominal" }
  ]
}
```

### What-if analysis

`POST /api/grid/scenarios/{id}/what-if`

Applies one or more overrides to a scenario and returns the delta against the
baseline simulation.

Request body:

```json
{
  "overrides": [
    { "nodeId": "gen-1", "field": "outputMw", "value": 300 },
    { "nodeId": "load-1", "field": "demandMw", "value": 450 }
  ]
}
```

Response body:

```json
{
  "baseline": { "unservedMw": 0, "peakDemandMw": 380 },
  "modified": { "unservedMw": 70, "peakDemandMw": 450 },
  "delta": { "unservedMw": 70, "peakDemandMw": 70 }
}
```

### Report generation

`POST /api/grid/scenarios/{id}/report`

Generates an impact report for a scenario (optionally with what-if overrides)
for capacity planning.

Request body:

```json
{
  "format": "json",
  "overrides": []
}
```

Response body:

```json
{
  "scenarioId": "peak-summer-demand",
  "generatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "impact": {
    "peakDemandMw": 380,
    "unservedMw": 0,
    "overloadedLinks": [],
    "headroomMw": 120
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Generator gen-1 has 16% headroom at peak demand."
  ]
}
```


## API Key Management (#833)

Providers can create API keys for programmatic access. Keys are stored as
SHA-256 hashes (`api_keys` table: `id`, `provider_id`, `key_hash`,
`permissions`, `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, …); the plaintext key is returned
only once. Management routes require `X-Admin-Key` and `X-Provider-Id`.

### `POST /api/keys/generate`

Body: `{ "name"?: string, "permissions"?: ("read"|"write"|"admin")[], "expiresInDays"?: number }`

`201` → `{ "key": "sg_…", "id": "…", "provider_id": "…", "permissions": ["read"], "expires_at": null, … }`

### `GET /api/keys`

Lists the provider's keys (no secrets): `{ "keys": [ … ] }`

### `DELETE /api/keys/:keyId`

Revokes a key. `204` on success, `404` if not found.

### Authenticating with a key

Send the key in the `X-API-Key` header. Routes protected with the
`requireApiKey(permission?)` middleware respond `401` for missing, invalid,
expired or revoked keys and `403` if the key lacks the required permission
(`admin` implies all permissions).

## Usage Prediction (#835)

### `GET /api/meters/:meterId/prediction`

Estimates when the meter balance will reach zero. A linear regression is fit
to the meter's daily usage cost over the last 30 days and projected forward.
Predictions are cached and refreshed daily (or when the balance changes).
The balance is read from the contract unless `?balance=<stroops>` is given.

```json
{
  "meterId": "METER1",
  "balance": 3000,
  "estimatedDaysRemaining": 30.0,
  "confidenceInterval": { "low": 25.4, "high": 36.1, "level": 0.95 },
  "avgDailyUsage": 100,
  "trendPerDay": 0.1,
  "trainingDays": 30,
  "generatedAt": "2026-09-25T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`estimatedDaysRemaining` is `null` when there is no usage history or usage is
not trending toward depletion.

## Widget Summary (#901)

### `GET /api/widgets/summary?meterId=<id>`

A compact payload (under 1 KB) for the iOS and Android home-screen widgets. It is cached for 5 minutes and served with
an `ETag`, so send `If-None-Match` to get a `304` when nothing has changed. See `docs/MOBILE_WIDGETS.md`.

```json
{
  "meterId": "METER1",
  "active": true,
  "balanceXlm": 12.5,
  "todayUnits": 3.2,
  "last7DaysUnits": [4.1, 3.9, 5.0, 4.4, 3.8, 4.0, 3.2],
  "daysRemaining": 3.1,
  "updatedAt": "2026-09-27T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Monthly Bills (#902)

Bills are generated on the 1st of each month, emailed as PDFs with a payment link, and kept as a permanent history.
Endpoints live under `/api/billing`. See `docs/BILLING.md`.

## Competitions (#903)

Monthly efficiency, trading and green-energy competitions with live SSE leaderboards and automatic prize payouts.
Endpoints live under `/api/competitions`. See `docs/COMPETITIONS.md`.

## Smart Home (#904)

- Failed webhook calls are logged but do not crash the IoT bridge
- Webhook timeouts can be configured via your HTTP client settings
- Consider idempotency keys on your webhook endpoint to handle retries

## Load Balancing (#889)
`POST /api/load-balancing/balance` — body `{ capacityKw, pricePerKwh, peakPriceThreshold?, loads: [{ id, demandKw, priority: "critical"|"high"|"normal"|"deferrable", override?: "on"|"off" }] }`.
Returns `{ on, off, servedKw, shedKw, baselineCost, optimisedCost, savingsPct }`. Critical loads are always served; `override` lets users force a load on/off; deferrable loads are shifted when the price exceeds `peakPriceThreshold`.

## Two-Factor Authentication (#890)
- `POST /api/2fa/enroll` `{ account, phone? }` → TOTP secret, `otpauthUrl` for authenticator apps, 10 single-use recovery codes.
- `POST /api/2fa/verify` `{ account, code, method?: "totp"|"sms"|"recovery" }` — 5 failures lock the account for 15 min.
- `POST /api/2fa/sms` `{ account }` — sends SMS fallback code (5-min expiry).
- `POST /api/2fa/recovery-codes` `{ account, code }` — regenerates recovery codes.
- Enforcement: `requireTwoFactor` middleware requires 2FA for accounts with value ≥ `TWO_FACTOR_ENFORCE_THRESHOLD`.

## Trading Bot API (#891)
See `docs/TRADING_API.md`.
Google Home and Alexa account linking (OAuth 2.0), device fulfillment, energy routines and privacy controls. Endpoints
live under `/api/smart-home`. See `docs/SMART_HOME.md`.
