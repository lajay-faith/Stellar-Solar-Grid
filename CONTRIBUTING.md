## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Stellar-Solar-Grid.git
   cd Stellar-Solar-Grid
   ```

2. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/Stellar-Solar-Grid.git
   ```

3. Create a feature branch off `main` using the following branch naming conventions:
   - `feat/` for new features (e.g. `feat/add-payment-flow`)
   - `fix/` for bug fixes (e.g. `fix/meter-validation`)
   - `refactor/` for code restructuring (e.g. `refactor/api-routes`)
   - `docs/` for documentation updates (e.g. `docs/api-guide`)
   - `infra/` for build scripts, Docker, or CI/CD updates (e.g. `infra/docker-setup`)

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- **Node.js**: version 20
- **Rust**: stable version (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **wasm32v1-none target**: installed via `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`
- **Stellar CLI**: latest version (for deploying and invoking contracts)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: for running containerized infrastructure (MQTT, checks, etc.)

### Smart Contract Development

We use `make` for common development workflows. You can run these commands from the project root or the `contracts` directory:

- **Build the contract:**
  ```bash
  make build
  ```
- **Run all contract tests:**
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
- **Deploy the contract to testnet:**
  ```bash
  make deploy
  ```

### Local Setup Steps

#### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Copy the example environment file and configure it:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
3. Install dependencies and start the Vite dev server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Copy the example environment file and configure it:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Install dependencies and start the Express server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Running the Full Stack with Docker
You can spin up the full stack using docker compose:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## HTTPS Local Development

The default `docker compose up` setup serves the frontend over plain HTTP on port 80. If you need HTTPS locally (e.g. to test Freighter wallet flows that require a secure origin, or browser APIs restricted to HTTPS), follow the steps below.

This setup uses [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate locally-trusted TLS certificates. It works on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows WSL2** without any browser security warnings.

> **The default HTTP setup is completely unaffected.** The `frontend-https` service is gated behind a Docker Compose profile and will never start unless you explicitly opt in.

### Prerequisites

- **macOS**: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) must be installed.
- **Linux / WSL2**: `curl` and `sudo` access are required. `apt-get` is used to install dependencies.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (same as the standard setup).

### Step 1 — Generate certificates

A helper script handles mkcert installation and certificate generation across all supported platforms:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-mkcert.sh
```

The script will:
1. Detect your OS (macOS, Linux, or WSL2).
2. Install `mkcert` if it is not already present.
3. Run `mkcert -install` to add the local CA to your system trust store (you may be prompted for your password).
4. Create a `certs/` directory at the repository root.
5. Generate `certs/localhost.pem` and `certs/localhost-key.pem`.

> **Security note:** The `certs/` directory is listed in `.gitignore`. Never commit your private key (`localhost-key.pem`).

#### WSL2 — trusting the cert in Windows browsers

The script installs the CA into the Linux trust store automatically. To also trust it in native Windows browsers (Chrome, Edge), run the following in an **Administrator PowerShell** terminal after running the script:

```powershell
Import-Certificate `
  -FilePath "$(wsl wslpath -w "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem")" `
  -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

### Step 2 — Start the HTTPS stack

```bash
docker compose --profile https up --build
```

This starts the `frontend-https` service alongside the existing `backend` and `mqtt` services. The HTTPS frontend:
- Listens on **port 443** (HTTPS, TLS terminated by nginx using your mkcert certs).
- Listens on **port 80** and issues a **301 redirect** to `https://localhost`.
- Mounts `./certs` into the container read-only at `/etc/nginx/certs`.
- Uses `frontend/nginx-https.conf` instead of the default `nginx.conf`.

Open [https://localhost](https://localhost) in your browser — you should see a valid, green padlock.

### Step 3 — Stop the HTTPS stack

```bash
docker compose --profile https down
```

### Troubleshooting HTTPS

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` | CA not trusted | Re-run `mkcert -install`, restart your browser |
| `no such file or directory: ./certs/localhost.pem` | Certs not generated | Run `bash scripts/setup-mkcert.sh` first |
| Port 80/443 already in use | Default `frontend` service is running | Stop it with `docker compose down` before using the `https` profile |
| WSL2: cert trusted in Linux but not Windows browser | CA not imported into Windows | Follow the PowerShell import step above |

## Running Tests

### Smart Contract Tests

Run the complete test suite:
```bash
cd contracts
cargo test
```

Run specific test modules:
```bash
cargo test test_register_and_payment
cargo test --test integration_tests
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test          # Run Jest tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm run test          # Run test suite
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
```

### End-to-End Testing

1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Deploy contract to testnet:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   stellar contract deploy \
     --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/solar_grid.wasm \
     --network testnet
   ```

3. Update environment files with deployed contract ID
4. Test the complete flow through the frontend dashboard

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript (frontend & backend)

- Use TypeScript strict mode — no `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Prefer `const` over `let`; avoid `var`.
- Name files in `kebab-case`, components in `PascalCase`.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Run `tsc --noEmit` before committing to catch type errors.

### Rust (contracts)

- Follow standard Rust formatting: `cargo fmt` before every commit.
- Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` and fix all warnings.
- Document public functions with `///` doc comments.
- Avoid `unwrap()` in contract code — handle errors explicitly.

### General

- No commented-out dead code in PRs.
- Keep commits atomic and write meaningful commit messages using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
  - `feat(...)`: A new feature (e.g., `feat(infra): add docker-compose validation`)
  - `fix(...)`: A bug fix (e.g., `fix(api): handle connection timeout`)
  - `docs(...)`: Documentation changes
  - `style(...)`: Formatting, semi-colons, etc.
  - `refactor(...)`: Restructuring code without changing behavior
  - `test(...)`: Adding or modifying tests
  - `infra(...)` / `chore(...)`: Infrastructure or dependency updates
  
  Example commit messages:
  ```
  feat: add weekly payment plan support
  fix: correct meter access check logic
  docs: update contract deployment steps
  ```

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables

- Never commit `.env` files or expose secret keys
- Use `.env.example` as a template with placeholder values
- Rotate keys regularly in production environments
- Use different keys for testnet and mainnet

### Smart Contract Security

- All contract functions validate inputs and handle errors explicitly
- Payment amounts are checked for overflow/underflow
- Access control is enforced through allowlists and ownership checks
- Test edge cases thoroughly, especially around balance calculations

### API Security

- All endpoints validate request schemas using Zod
- Rate limiting is implemented for payment endpoints
- Webhook signatures are verified before processing
- CORS is configured appropriately for the frontend domain

## Troubleshooting

For a full list of common issues with symptoms, root causes, and step-by-step fixes, see the dedicated **[Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**.

### Quick reference

**Contract deployment fails:**
- Ensure you have testnet XLM in your account (`curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"`)
- Check that the WASM file was built successfully (`make build`)
- Verify network configuration in Stellar CLI

**Backend fails to start:**
- Check that all required environment variables are set in `backend/.env`
- Ensure MQTT broker is running (`docker compose up mqtt`)
- Verify Stellar RPC endpoint is accessible (`curl https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org/`)

**Frontend build errors:**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Check that `VITE_CONTRACT_ID` matches the deployed contract
- Ensure Freighter wallet is installed and set to Testnet

**Tests failing:**
- For contract tests: ensure `wasm32v1-none` target is installed (`rustup target add wasm32v1-none`)
- For frontend tests: check that test environment variables are set
- For integration tests: ensure all services are running

### Getting Help

- Check existing [Issues](../../issues) for similar problems
- Open a [Discussion](../../discussions) for questions
- Review the [API documentation](backend/API.md) for endpoint details
