# SolarGrid Smart Contract

## Event Schema

The contract emits Soroban events for real-time monitoring by backend and frontend systems.

### Event Topics

All events use the namespace `solargrid` (EVT_NS) as the second topic.

#### meter_registered
- **Topic 0:** `mtr_reg` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (Symbol)
- **Data:** `owner` (Address)

Emitted when a new meter is registered.

#### payment_received
- **Topic 0:** `pmt_rcvd` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (Symbol)
- **Data:** `(payer: Address, token_address: Address, amount: i128, plan: PaymentPlan)`

Emitted when a payment is made to top up a meter's balance.

#### meter_activated
- **Topic 0:** `mtr_actv` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (Symbol)
- **Data:** `()` (empty)

Emitted when a meter is activated (via `make_payment` or `set_active(true)`).

#### usage_updated
- **Topic 0:** `usg_upd` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (Symbol)
- **Data:** `(units: u64, cost: i128)`

Emitted when energy usage is recorded and cost deducted from balance.

#### meter_deactivated
- **Topic 0:** `mtr_deact` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (String)
- **Data:** `MeterDeactivated` (`meter_id: String`, `reason: Symbol`, `timestamp: u64`)

Emitted when a meter is deactivated in any of the following scenarios:
- Balance depleted to zero (`balance_zero`) in `apply_usage()` or refund
- Administrative deactivation (`admin_action`) via `set_active(false)`, `set_meter_active(false)`, `deactivate_meter()`, or `batch_deactivate_meters()`
- Grace period expiry (`expiry`) in `apply_usage()`

#### meter_decommissioned
- **Topic 0:** `mtr_dcom` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (String)
- **Data:** `MeterDecommissioned` (`meter_id: String`, `owner: Address`, `refunded: i128`, `timestamp: u64`)

Emitted when an admin permanently decommissions a meter via `decommission_meter(meter_id)`.
Decommissioning is terminal: the meter's `decommissioned` flag is set to `true`, any
remaining balance is refunded to the meter owner, and all subsequent operations on the
meter are rejected with `ContractError::MeterDecommissioned`.

#### batch_skip
- **Topic 0:** `btch_skip` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (Symbol)
- **Data:** `()` (empty)

Emitted when a meter ID in `batch_update_usage` is not found and skipped.
Also emitted (with the same shape) by `batch_register_meters` for each entry
skipped because the meter ID already exists, is duplicated within the batch,
or the owner is not on the allowlist.
Also emitted by `batch_deactivate_meters` for each meter that is not found
or already inactive.

#### revenue_withdrawn
- **Topic 0:** `rev_wdrl` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `provider` (Address)
- **Data:** `(token_address: Address, amount: i128)`

Emitted when the provider withdraws accumulated revenue.

#### meter_transferred (MeterTransferred)
- **Topic 0:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 1:** `MeterTransferred`
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (String)
- **Data:** `(old_owner: Address, new_owner: Address, meter_id: String)`

Emitted when meter ownership is transferred via `transfer_meter(meter_id, new_owner)`. Updates `OwnerMeters` index for both old and new owners, resets `units_used` for the new owner, and requires authorization from the current owner or admin.

#### discount_created / discount_revoked / discount_applied

Closes #687 — promotional discount codes.

- `discount_created` — topics `(solargrid, disc_new, code: String)`, data `(discount_pct: u32, valid_until: u64, max_uses: u32)`. Emitted by `admin_create_discount`.
- `discount_revoked` — topics `(solargrid, disc_rvk, code: String)`, no data. Emitted by `admin_revoke_discount`.
- `discount_applied` — topics `(solargrid, disc_appl, code: String)`, data `(meter_id: String, amount: i128, final_cost: i128, discount_pct: u32)`. Emitted by `make_payment_with_discount`.

#### withdrawal_announced / emergency_withdrawal / withdrawal_cancelled

Closes #686 — timelocked emergency admin withdrawal. `emergency_withdraw(amount, recipient)` is a two-step call: the first call announces (starts a 48h timelock), and calling again with the same `amount`/`recipient` after the timelock elapses executes the transfer.

- `withdrawal_announced` — topics `(solargrid, wd_ann)`, data `(recipient: Address, amount: i128, announced_at: u64)`. Emitted on the announcing call.
- `emergency_withdrawal` — topics `(solargrid, emrg_wd)`, data `(recipient: Address, amount: i128)`. Emitted on the executing call, once the 48h timelock has elapsed. `amount` here is the actual amount transferred, capped at the contract's token balance.
- `withdrawal_cancelled` — topics `(solargrid, wd_cncl)`, no data. Emitted by `cancel_emergency_withdrawal`.

`emergency_withdraw` requires the contract to be frozen (`freeze_contract`) and caps `amount` at `TOTAL_REVENUE` — cumulative gross revenue ever collected via `make_payment`/`make_payment_with_discount` — so a compromised admin key can't drain more than customers have actually paid in, regardless of the contract's raw token balance.

## Meter Sharing for Multi-Tenant Buildings (Issue #851)

Multi-tenant buildings can split a single meter's cost among multiple residents.
The meter owner registers co-payers and assigns each a `share_percentage`; usage
costs are then deducted proportionally from each co-payer's balance.

### `add_meter_share_holder(meter_id: String, co_payer: Address, share_percentage: u32)`

Callable by the meter owner (or admin). Adds `co_payer` to the meter's
shareholder set with the given `share_percentage` (in basis points, `0..=10000`).
The sum of all shareholders' percentages must not exceed `10000` (100%).
Requires authorization from the meter owner. Emits `share_holder_added`.

### `get_meter_shareholders(meter_id: String) -> Vec<(Address, u32)>`

Returns the list of `(co_payer, share_percentage)` pairs currently registered for
the meter. Returns an empty vector for meters with no shareholders.

### Proportional cost deduction

When usage is recorded via `apply_usage`/`batch_update_usage`, the computed cost
is split across shareholders: each co-payer is debited
`cost * share_percentage / 10000` from their own balance, and the meter owner is
debited the remainder. If a co-payer's balance is insufficient, the shortfall is
charged to the meter owner so the full cost is always collected.

#### share_holder_added
- **Topic 0:** `shr_add` (symbol_short)
- **Topic 1:** `solargrid` (EVT_NS)
- **Topic 2:** `meter_id` (String)
- **Data:** `(co_payer: Address, share_percentage: u32)`

Emitted when a co-payer is added to a meter via `add_meter_share_holder`.

## Backend Event Listener

The backend can subscribe to these events via the Stellar RPC `getEvents` endpoint:

```javascript
// Example: Listen for payment_received events
const events = await rpc.getEvents({
  filters: [
    {
      type: 'contract',
      contractIds: [CONTRACT_ID],
      topics: [['pmt_rcvd', 'solargrid']]
    }
  ]
});
```

## Testing

All event emissions are covered by unit tests:
- `test_event_meter_registered`
- `test_event_payment_received_and_meter_activated`
- `test_event_usage_updated_and_meter_deactivated`
- `test_event_meter_deactivated_via_set_active`
- `test_event_meter_activated_via_set_active`
- `test_batch_update_usage_skips_invalid_meter` (includes batch_skip event)
- `test_emergency_withdraw_announce_then_execute_after_timelock`, `test_emergency_withdraw_requires_frozen`, `test_emergency_withdraw_capped_at_total_revenue`, `test_emergency_withdraw_capped_at_current_balance_if_lower`, `test_cancel_emergency_withdrawal`, `test_emergency_withdraw_reannounce_restarts_timelock` (issue #686)
- `test_admin_create_and_get_discount`, `test_make_payment_with_discount_applies_percent_off`, `test_make_payment_with_discount_respects_max_uses`, `test_make_payment_with_discount_respects_expiry`, `test_admin_revoke_discount` (issue #687)
- `test_add_meter_share_holder`, `test_add_meter_share_holder_rejects_over_100_percent`, `test_get_meter_shareholders`, `test_apply_usage_splits_cost_proportionally`, `test_apply_usage_share_holder_shortfall_charged_to_owner` (issue #851)

**Note:** the crate's test module currently fails to compile on `main` for reasons unrelated to these two features (many pre-existing tests pass a `Symbol` where the `meter_id: String` parameters now expect a `String`, plus a `ContractEvents::iter` API drift) — `cargo test` cannot run for this crate until that's fixed. The new code above was verified with `cargo check` (library) and `cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release` (both clean), and its own test functions were confirmed to produce zero compiler errors by cross-referencing `cargo check --tests` output against their line ranges.

### Batch Deactivate Tests (Issue #664)
- `test_batch_deactivate_all_active` — deactivates 3 active meters in one call
- `test_batch_deactivate_skips_inactive` — skips already-inactive meters
- `test_batch_deactivate_skips_nonexistent` — skips meters that don't exist
- `test_batch_deactivate_mixed` — mix of active, inactive, and nonexistent
- `test_batch_deactivate_empty` — empty vector returns zero counts
- `test_batch_deactivate_too_large` — rejects batches over 50 entries
- `test_batch_deactivate_emits_events` — verifies mtr_deact events

### Bulk Meter Registration (Issue #818)
The `batch_register_meters(meters: Vec<(String, Address)>)` function enables energy providers to register up to 50 meters in a single transaction:
- **Max Batch Size:** 50 meters per call. Returns `ContractError::BatchTooLarge` if exceeded.
- **Input Validation:** Pre-validates empty meter IDs, duplicate IDs in batch, existing meters, and owner allowlist membership.
- **Event Emission:** Emits standard `meter_registered` (`mtr_reg`) event for each successfully registered meter and `batch_skip` (`btch_skip`) for failed/skipped entries.
- **Detailed Error Reporting:** Returns `Vec<BatchRegisterResult>` with `meter_id`, `success: bool`, and `error: Option<String>` detailing reasons for any partial failures (`empty_meter_id`, `duplicate_in_batch`, `meter_already_exists`, `owner_not_allowlisted`).

## Admin Audit Log (#836)

Every state-changing admin function (allowlist, oracle, freeze/pause, pricing,
refunds, meter lifecycle, collaborators, distributions, migrations, multisig
configuration, emergency withdrawals) appends an immutable `AdminAuditEntry` to
persistent storage and emits an `AdminAct` event:

| Field             | Type      | Description                              |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`              | `u64`     | Sequential entry id (0-based)            |
| `action_type`     | `String`  | Name of the admin function invoked       |
| `admin_address`   | `Address` | Admin that authorized the call           |
| `affected_entity` | `String`  | Entity affected by the action            |
| `timestamp`       | `u64`     | Ledger timestamp of the action           |

Query functions:

- `get_audit_log_count() -> u64`
- `get_audit_logs(filter: AuditLogFilter, offset: u32, limit: u32) -> Vec<AdminAuditEntry>`
  - `filter.action_type`, `filter.admin`, `filter.from_ts`, `filter.to_ts` are all optional.
  - `offset` skips matching entries; `limit` is capped at 100.

## Energy Token Staking (#899)

Implemented in `solar_grid/src/staking.rs`. See `docs/STAKING_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`
for the security review.

Admin setup:

- `configure_staking(stake_token, reward_token, reward_rate, cooldown_secs)`: `reward_rate`
  is reward units per second shared by all stakers; `cooldown_secs` ≤ 90 days. Tokens
  can't be switched once staking has activity.
- `fund_staking_rewards(from, amount)`: tops up the reward reserve (anyone may fund).

User functions (each requires the staker's auth):

| Function | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `stake(staker, amount)` | Blocked while the contract is paused |
| `request_unstake(staker, amount) -> u64` | Stops rewards and voting power at once; returns the unlock time. A new request adds to the bucket and restarts the cooldown |
| `withdraw_unstaked(staker) -> i128` | After the cooldown |
| `cancel_unstake(staker) -> i128` | Restakes tokens that are cooling down |
| `claim_staking_rewards(staker) -> i128` | Pays all accrued rewards |

Views: `get_staking_config`, `get_staking_pool`, `get_stake_info(staker)`,
`get_voting_power(voter)`, `get_total_voting_power()`.

Rewards use a reward-per-share accumulator (scale 1e12): O(1) per call, pro-rata to
stake, and emission stops when the funded reserve is exhausted. Voting power is the
active stake; pass `get_voting_power(voter)` as the `weight` to
`governance::vote_on_proposal`, and `get_total_voting_power()` to size quorum.

Events (`solar`, …): `stk_cfg`, `stk_fund`, `staked`, `unstk_req`, `unstaked`,
`unstk_cxl`, `stk_claim`.

New errors: `StakingNotConfigured` (38), `InsufficientStake` (39),
`NoPendingUnstake` (40), `CooldownNotElapsed` (41).

## Energy Export Certificates (#871)

Non-fungible certificates attesting that a meter exported renewable energy to
the grid. Implemented in `solar_grid/src/certificates.rs`.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `mint_export_certificate(issuer, meter_id, energy_wh, period_start, period_end, reading_hash) -> u64` | `issuer` (admin or registered oracle) must authorize. Mints to the meter owner. Periods are `[start, end)` in Unix seconds, may not end in the future, and may not overlap the meter's previously certified period |
| `transfer_export_certificate(id, to)` | Holder must authorize; retired certificates cannot move |
| `retire_export_certificate(id)` | Holder claims the renewable attribute; irreversible |
| `verify_export_certificate(id, reading_hash) -> bool` | True when the certificate exists and commits to `reading_hash` |

Views: `get_export_certificate(id)`, `get_certificates_by_owner(owner, offset, limit)`
(limit capped at 100), `get_certificate_count()`, `get_last_certified_period_end(meter_id)`.

Metadata (`ExportCertificate`): `id`, `meter_id`, `producer`, `owner`,
`energy_wh`, `period_start`, `period_end`, `issued_at`, `issuer`,
`reading_hash`, `retired_at`.

`reading_hash` is the SHA-256 of the canonical JSON (keys sorted) of the
reading payload the certificate was minted from. The backend computes it in
`backend/src/lib/exportCertificates.ts`, prints it on the PDF certificate, and
exposes `GET /api/certificates/:id/verify` so third parties can check a PDF
against the chain.

Events (`solargrid`, …, `id`): `cert_mint` `(meter_id, producer, energy_wh,
period_start, period_end, reading_hash)`, `cert_xfer` `(from, to)`,
`cert_ret` `(owner, energy_wh, retired_at)`.

New errors: `CertificateNotFound` (50), `InvalidCertificatePeriod` (51),
`CertificatePeriodOverlap` (52), `CertificateRetired` (53).
